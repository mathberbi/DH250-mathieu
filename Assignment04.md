# DH250-Assignment 04-Contextual Inquiry

## Introductory Steps
### * Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
> My project aims at providing the user with ways to learn Korean through Popular Culture Elements (K-pop, Dramas, Variety Shows...)

**What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)**
> According to the Maslow's hiearchy of needs, those involved for that activity would be a combination of Psychological needs and Self-fulfillment needs - depending on the motivation that the user has to learn Korean. I would say that mainly, it would be a matter of "Self-actualisation" (Self-fulfillment need) because a lot of users who use apps to learn Korean are usely self-learners. On the other side, if the user is also learning Korean to communicate with friends, or member of their family - it could be associated to "belongingness" (Psychological needs). Finally, I think that it is important to provide a way for the user to feel accomplished through their learning, so it also covers some "Esteem needs." 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> The traditional solution are, of course, Korean classes. With the increasing popularity of Korean popular culture, there has been an increase of interest for learning Korean all over the world. More and more universities offer Korean classes, but also private institutions also provide instruction for Korean language. When it comes to online learning, there are a few websites/apps that are focusing on teaching Korean. Those websites are mainly online textbooks who provide a variety of learning material, but none of them really use Korean pop culture as a medium to teach. There are some youtube channels that are trying to do so, but as far as I know, none of them developed into an external platform.

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> Nowadays, there is a big gap in the field of Korean Studies between language classes who only focus on language and when learning about the culture, historical, and society context is in the background / and the content classes that are only focusing on the culture/historical/society aspects without going further in the language part. That leads to a problem in which students are either very knowledgeable about Korea but not proeficient in Korean, or the reverse situation. Using Korean pop culture as a gateway to learn Korean would help making more developed classes. Even if this problem is mainly related to the major of Korean Studies in University, of course using an online platform (digital technology aspect) wwould make the teaching material broadly available, and reach a wider target of people. Also, Korean pop culture relies heavily on social media platforms so it seems like it would be easy to integrate those elements all-together. 

### * Step 02: Target users 
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
> People who are interested by any aspect of Korean pop culture (Music, Drama, Movie, Food, Beauty, Game, Variety Shows...) and want to learn Korean through that medium. It could go from Students (starting Middle school to College, Graduate Students) but also working adults. The final goal would be to provide content that is not only relevant to beginners of learning Korean, but people who also have already some basics of Korean. (Those people are more and more a majority in the Korean pop culture fandom)

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
> If they use the web-based version of the application, they would be able in any internet connected place. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
> The goal for the users would be to learn at the same time something related to language (grammar pattern, vocabulary...) but also learn, on the broader aspect, associate what they learn with a specific cultural context (that could be realted to Korean popular culture). The operation would be to start from an authentic material, provide steps for the learner to figure out what is the object of study, and then provide explanations/practice questions.

### * Step 03: Pick research Methods
> I decided to combine interview and participant observation. First, I will start by asking more in depth to my participant how they approach language learning and what kind of tools they use to learn languages by themselves. Then, I will try two types of actions that I would like to develop through my future platform: 1) Look at a clip from a Korean TV show and explore a cultural concept realated to language, 2) look at lyrics of a K-pop song and see how we can make it into a lesson. 

### * Step 04: Observation/Interview Guide

### * Step 05: Conducting the Research
### * Step 06: Reflection
