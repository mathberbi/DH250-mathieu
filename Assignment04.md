# DH250-Assignment 04-Contextual Inquiry

## Introductory Steps
## * Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 
**What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?**
> My project aims at providing the user with ways to learn Korean through Popular Culture Elements (K-pop, Dramas, Variety Shows...)

**What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)**
> According to the Maslow's hiearchy of needs, those involved for that activity would be a combination of Psychological needs and Self-fulfillment needs - depending on the motivation that the user has to learn Korean. I would say that mainly, it would be a matter of "Self-actualisation" (Self-fulfillment need) because a lot of users who use apps to learn Korean are usely self-learners. On the other side, if the user is also learning Korean to communicate with friends, or member of their family - it could be associated to "belongingness" (Psychological needs). Finally, I think that it is important to provide a way for the user to feel accomplished through their learning, so it also covers some "Esteem needs." 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> The traditional solution are, of course, Korean classes. With the increasing popularity of Korean popular culture, there has been an increase of interest for learning Korean all over the world. More and more universities offer Korean classes, but also private institutions also provide instruction for Korean language. When it comes to online learning, there are a few websites/apps that are focusing on teaching Korean. Those websites are mainly online textbooks who provide a variety of learning material, but none of them really use Korean pop culture as a medium to teach. There are some youtube channels that are trying to do so, but as far as I know, none of them developed into an external platform.

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> Nowadays, there is a big gap in the field of Korean Studies between language classes who only focus on language and when learning about the culture, historical, and society context is in the background / and the content classes that are only focusing on the culture/historical/society aspects without going further in the language part. That leads to a problem in which students are either very knowledgeable about Korea but not proeficient in Korean, or the reverse situation. Using Korean pop culture as a gateway to learn Korean would help making more developed classes. Even if this problem is mainly related to the major of Korean Studies in University, of course using an online platform (digital technology aspect) wwould make the teaching material broadly available, and reach a wider target of people. Also, Korean pop culture relies heavily on social media platforms so it seems like it would be easy to integrate those elements all-together. 

## * Step 02: Target users 
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
> People who are interested by any aspect of Korean pop culture (Music, Drama, Movie, Food, Beauty, Game, Variety Shows...) and want to learn Korean through that medium. It could go from Students (starting Middle school to College, Graduate Students) but also working adults. The final goal would be to provide content that is not only relevant to beginners of learning Korean, but people who also have already some basics of Korean. (Those people are more and more a majority in the Korean pop culture fandom)

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
> If they use the web-based version of the application, they would be able in any internet connected place. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
> The goal for the users would be to learn at the same time something related to language (grammar pattern, vocabulary...) but also learn, on the broader aspect, associate what they learn with a specific cultural context (that could be realted to Korean popular culture). The operation would be to start from an authentic material, provide steps for the learner to figure out what is the object of study, and then provide explanations/practice questions.

## * Step 03: Pick research Methods
> I decided to combine interview and participant observation. First, I will start by asking more in depth to my participant how they approach language learning and what kind of tools they use to learn languages by themselves. Then, I will try two types of actions that I would like to develop through my future platform: 1) Look at a clip from a Korean TV show and explore a cultural concept related to language, 2) look at lyrics of a K-pop song and see how we can make it into a lesson.

### Interesting Quotations
> (5:56) I feel accomplished when I'm, like, I coincidentally, like, outside of a classroom environment, encounter something and find that I understand it. So like, I don't know, like, I watch a weather forecast the Japanese and I understand everything or likesocial media, I find that someone(big hit), posted a photo, and they can read the whole caption. 
> (10:37) There's a lot of like, it's great for beginners so like, you have a lot of really really rich beginner content like one was, like two years ago I using like a 40 minute YouTube video I learned how to read and write in Korean and like a day, so I think it's really quite excellent for that but as far as other resources and higher level like there's like a like a good beginning, nothing really for like the middle levels where you're trying to see like, advanced mastery. And then by the time you're advanced, you can just pretty much I don't know like watch it YouTube video that doesn't really it's not like learning focus.
> (50:33) One of my complaints about classroom environments is that because the school system or whatever, like your professors, or whatever want you to have the best make the best impression everything is formal. So you don't get a lot of opportunities to hear informal, like spoken language, like how people actually use it. So this clip was good in that sense. Also, getting familiar with like, the speed that people talk, even when you don't understand being listening to the back and forth several times sort of helps with that rhythm. 
> (54:10) Like, if I knew maybe more words in the song, I would have been able to notice that it was like a grammatical syllable versus just like a lesson. So it might just be one of those things where you're you're adjusting or like you're making sure that whoever is going to listen to that, next is like, prepped enough to be able to take it. That's my only thing. But, um, on the other hand, once you got to that bond part and you're like, Okay, like you explained the whole line to me. Mm hmm. It even though it took me a while, I was able to understand what, um, the use of dawn and like what it was probably meant for. Um, yeah. And then I think another thing that was probably out of your control is like, obviously no shit like, like, if you try to teach someone English by using ariana grande de, it's gonna be really hard because songs the way that they are is like, the people will eat up syllables or obviously with singing, singing and pitches. The way that pitches work is they distort vowels? Mm hmm. Um, so I didn't know if it was that, or dawn. When I'm speaking, the distinction is obvious. But when it's song they blend together. So sometimes, sometimes songs aren't that good for, um, listening. Mm hmm. But I do think that like, if it were a whole grammar pattern, and you could see the subtitles beforehand and be like, Okay, I'm gonna play to you once. What do you think the person is saying by this whole sentence? And then you play it again, with the, like, after sorting it out, I think it would register a lot better.

## * Step 06: Reflection
> Once again, I was very thankful to my participant because their insight throughout the interview/task observation was very very detailed and useful in shaping my broader project. Here are the several takes that I took from their answers and their behavior during the tasks.
### Using YouTube as an external ressource
> I found out that my participant was using YouTube and Tiktok as a ressource for their self-learning experience. The good aspect with YouTube is that it provides a lot of content from Korean media companies, and if embedded in a website/application it doesn't bring any problem of copyright - it even makes their views grow. The participant emphasized that YouTube had a lot of content for beginners, but not a lot for higher levels, starting intermediate.
### Importance of what happens "outside the classroom."
> In their interview, the participant said that they feel accomplished when they could retrive something they learned in the classroom in another context. During the first task that had also as a goal to familiarize the learner with the different level of speechs in Korean, the participant stressed that in the classroom, because it was too formal of a setting, they never heard about 반말 or 존댓말. This cultural aspect is inherently related to language and helps fulfilling my intention of teaching both at the same time.
### The relevance of K-pop songs in Korean Learning
> The participant enjoyed the first task way more than the second, and was way more responsive to the first one. Their idea that K-pop songs could be quite difficult to use for teaching was especially refreshing when they mentioned the different of pitch that made the prononciation different, and thus the exercise of "Fill in the blank" more difficult. However, they emphasized that with more context and a little bit more of indications, it could be helpful to figure out the grammar by themselves rather than being taught the grammar like a textbook.
### Using Korean pop culture as a gateway to Korean learning... but what about the reverse effect?
> My participant has an interesting relationship with pop culture because they qualify their interest for popular culture as "artificial" but still find it interesting/useful to use it as a way to learn more Korean. I think this show that using Korean pop culture for Korean language education could not only be seen as an effective tool, but in the reverse aspect, raise the popularity of some Korean pop culture aspects that do not get as many exposure as K-pop or K-dramas for example.
