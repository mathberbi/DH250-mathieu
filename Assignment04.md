# DH250-Assignment 04-Contextual Inquiry

## Introductory Steps
### * Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
> My project aims at providing the user with ways to learn Korean through Popular Culture Elements (K-pop, Dramas, Variety Shows...)

**What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)**
> According to the Maslow's hiearchy of needs, those involved for that activity would be a combination of Psychological needs and Self-fulfillment needs - depending on the motivation that the user has to learn Korean. I would say that mainly, it would be a matter of "Self-actualisation" (Self-fulfillment need) because a lot of users who use apps to learn Korean are usely self-learners. On the other side, if the user is also learning Korean to communicate with friends, or member of their family - it could be associated to "belongingness" (Psychological needs). Finally, I think that it is important to provide a way for the user to feel accomplished through their learning, so it also covers some "Esteem needs." 

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> Even though there are already applications and website to learn Korean in a kind of digital textbook way, those 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

### * Step 02: Target users 
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
