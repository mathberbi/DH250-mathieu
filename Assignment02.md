## Usability Evaluation with Users

### Introduction about Talk to Me in Korean
TalktomeinKorean.com is a Korean learning platform that started first as a podcast. After it got more and more popular, the content of the lessons were uploaded on a website. Now the website is subscription based and provides more content to their paid-users, but they still have a quite decent amount of content available for people on the free account. They also have Korean language learning textbooks and use their websites as a platform to sell them.

### Purpose and what I wanted to test
After the heuristic evaluation, my main concerns regarding the user design of TalktomeinKorean were as follow:
* The long-scrolling layout that could hide a lot of what the website has to offer.
* The navigation between the different lessons. (connection between system/real world)
* The navigation inside of a lesson, too linear. (user control and freedom)
* The difficulty of access for the help section. (help and documentation)

Based on those four different heuristic points, I designed three different tasks that would make the user go over the table of contents of the lesson, but also go over the different parts of one lesson, and finally, access the help platform.
After putting all together the material, I asked my participant to log in on zoom - set up their screen so it has both the website and the survey on the same window, and we then proceed to a screen recording in which I guided the participant through the different parts.

### Reflexion
* First, I was very thankful to my participant because they were always wording their thoughts - and even providing extra information on what they also would have done differently. The first takeaway that I take from this experiment is that it helped to see how my participant was processing the first task because their way of thinking was different for mine. For example, when asked to access the table of content of Level 2 - they directly went to "Courses," when I went to "My Learning Center." I was surprised to see that actually, the participant did not use the menu "my learning center" at all during the whole process - when it was something that I mainly used when I was processing the heuristic evaluation last week.
* Second, as expected, my participant showed difficulties to navigate in between the lessons, arguing that the arrows used were not visible enough. The fact that it was in a bright color made it difficult to figure out if they could click or not. During the review test, my participant had to use the zoom function of google chrome to read the questions of the quizz. That was an accessibility feature that I hadn't think of.
* Third, the participant had difficulties to access the help section (on a separate website) - and it was refreshing to see that through their process of figuring out where to click to find it, they actually discovered a "questions?" button that is apparent only in the table of content of the levels, but disappears once inside of a lesson.
* Finally, my participant did not really expressed any concern regarding the long-scrolling layout of the website, or about the fact that it is difficult to re-take a quiz once done. This was interesting to see how they thought differently on those aspects.

### Takeaways
For the UT, here are the different takeways I get from this pilot UT.
* Putting the windows one next to each other might cause some problem and influence the result of the test. My participant had a different layout of the website while using it next to the questions, while my layout while doing the heuristic evaluation was on the full window.
* Because I explained to my user that it was for my user design class, they were very aware of this point during doing the test - which could be a good or a bad thing since it could also influence the way they react while executing the tasks.
* I had a typo on my material that was a little misleading, so before processing to the test it is crucial to review all the questions one by one.

For my own app design, here are the different takeaways I get from this pilot UT.
* There is a need to show in a functional, yet esthetic way the different features of the website. The participant did not see the learning center at all during their experiment. Maybe showing a widget in the home page could be a way to proceed.
* The Help "platform" should be consistantly available - even inside a lesson.
* It is important to clarify the navigation process in-between the lessons - and color is important.
