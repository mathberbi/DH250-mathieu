# DH250_Assignment 05_UX Storytelling
# Persona + Scenario

## Purpose of UX Storytelling in my Project
> Since my project is focused on teaching and pedagogy, it is crucial to put myself in the shoes of different type of users, and see how those type of users would get something from my project in order to help them with their Korean learning journey. Also, in the same way as people have different ways to learn something, people have different ways to use a product - so it is very important to evaluate the different possibilities to reach the widest audience as possible.

## Presentation of the two features, their scenario and their journey map
### Feature 1
> Learn how to read the Korean alphabet in a fun way (Different speeds: 1 week / 3 days / 1 hour)
### Feature 1 - Scenario w/ Tamera
**Why?**
> Tamera feels like she will go crazy, but she can’t stop! After her friend showed her the new BTS’ music video “Dynamite” on YouTube - she wanted, as a joke to a friend, to learn the name of the members. Slowly, she falls into the “BTS slump” - she watches one interview, and then another video, and then another, and another… Quickly, she picks up the names of the seven members and suddenly remembers her Korean 1 classes in her sophomore year at NYU. She was so mad at people always bringing up K-pop in class, but they were getting good so fast in comparison to her. And now look at her! If she picked up Korean again? After all - it’s been a while, and she’s been wanting to learn a new language. She looks around in her room, and try to find her old textbooks. Oh, finally they’re here. A problem arises, she forgot how to read! She thinks it would be nice if BTS members could give her a refresher.
**How?**
> Tamera texts her friend to confess that she is into BTS now and that she wants to pick Korean again. Her friend - who is now taking Advanced Korean - tells her about Deok_UP, an app that uses Korean pop culture-related content as a pedagogical tool. She uses it to get grammar explanations and foster her vocabulary, but there is a section that teaches you how to read in only a week and even less! Tamera downloads Deok_UP, open the application. On the “introductions” screen, she clicks on “I am starting from scratch.” She now has the choice to go through different programs that are adapted to how fast she wants to learn. 1 week / 3 days / 1 hour. Since she is so impatient, she chooses 1 hour. Using the name of BTS members, she gets to associate every letter with their reading. After an hour, she takes a test - she is already doing better!

### Feature 2
> Read cultural notes on specific passages of Korean variety shows/drama + learn grammar patterns used by the protagonists + get a vocab list
### Feature 2 - Scenario w/ Tamera
**Why?**
> Shawn asks his manager if he knew a little more about their company headquarters in Seoul, and if it was really possible to go there to work for one or two years. His manager said that indeed, it was possible to do so, but that he would need to have at least some conversational level in Korean to communicate with his colleagues. Shawn has always been obsessed with K-pop and Korean pop culture is a part of his life. Sometimes, on the weekends, he even tells his friend he is busy and has work to do at home but in reality, he just wants to watch his variety shows alone. A Sunday afternoon at home, he finished watching the new Running Man episode and thinks about how good it would be if he didn’t have to wait for the subtitles, and be a little more up to date with the release of the episodes in Korea. As he is scrolling through his TikTok “for you page”, he comes through someone telling how “Deok_UP” is useful to learn snippets of Korean culture, but also new Korean grammar patterns and vocabulary by using variety show clips. Exactly what he needed! He downloads the app on the app store.
**How?**
> Shawn downloads the app and opens it. On the introduction page, he takes a quick level test and gets diagnosed as an “advanced beginner.” Fair enough! He can read, knows basic grammars, but doesn’t really know how to use it. He goes through the different menu and finds the “Business Korean” section. That would be perfect for him! He taps it, and get access to a step-by-step college-like syllabus that go over the different aspects of Korean company culture, through a Korean drama called Misaeng. He starts the first lesson - that has listening, speaking, writing, and grammar/vocab section. He watches the first clip and can already catch some words that he knows! The whole lesson is about the culture of “company diners,” but also about levels of politeness and what to avoid using with co-workers.
