# DH250_Assignment 07_High-Fidelity Prototype (Last Version: November 30th, 2020)
## Description of Project, Features and Relevance with Scenario
Deok_UP is an app to teach Korean through Korean Popular Culture Content. Deok_UP (덕업) is from the word 덕후 in Korean that means "fan" and 업 is a play on the word "UP" pronounced as 업 in Korean, but also a way to allude at the expression "덕업일치" that means "when something you enjoy becomes your work." - This saying kind of reflects well my wish to make people able to reach their personal/professional goal of learning Korean in a enjoyable way, and that's why I decided this name. In this assignment, I focused on the graphic design, trying to convey as best as I could the visual identity of Deok_UP that I already have done through my YouTube channel. I also had to take into consideration the accessiblity and make some changes in the way. Then, I went back to the scenarii/persona that I used in my previous assignments and pulled out a list of tasks based on it.

**First Scenario/Persona**
> Tamera texts her friend to confess that she is into BTS now and that she wants to pick Korean again. Her friend - who is now taking Advanced Korean - tells her about Deok_UP, an app that uses Korean pop culture-related content as a pedagogical tool. She uses it to get grammar explanations and foster her vocabulary, but there is a section that teaches you how to read in only a week and even less! Tamera downloads Deok_UP, open the application. On the “introductions” screen, she clicks on “I can read Korean a bit.” She now has the choice to go through different programs that are adapted to how fast she wants to learn. 70 minutes / 7 hours / 7 days. Since she is so impatient, she chooses 1 hour. Using the name of BTS members, she gets to associate every letter with their reading. After an hour, she takes a test - she is already remembering some vowels!
* Tasks/Features from the first scenario
  - Set a new account on Deok_UP
  - Take a quick level assessment test, say that she knows a bit the alphabet, and choose the 70 minutes review mode of the Korean Alphabet.
  - Choose BTS as a review partner
  - Review the Vowels
  - Do the first exercise (spot the vowels in BTS' Jin real name)
  

**Second Scenario/Persona**
> Shawn downloads the app and opens it. On the introduction page, he says that he can read. Who cannot read the Korean alphabet these days? He can read, knows basic grammars, but doesn’t really know how to use it. He goes through the different menu and finds the “Business Korean” section. That would be perfect for him! He taps it, and get access to a step-by-step college-like syllabus that go over the different aspects of Korean company culture, through a Korean drama called Misaeng. He starts the first lesson - that has listening, speaking, writing, and grammar/vocab section. He watches the first clip and can already catch some words that he knows! The whole lesson is about the culture of “company diners,” but also about levels of politeness and what to avoid using with co-workers. 
* Tasks/Features from the second scenario
  - Set a new account on Deok_UP
  - Take the quick level assessment test, and say "Yes, I can read."
  - Access to "Survival Korean" and "Business Korean"
  - Read Level 1 table of content
  - Watch the first clip to practice listening

## Graphic Design and Impression Test 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e9DSCMh3A9Wsp0QhKimRFmDWfNgPzQyK/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> is a (updated) version PDF of all the different screens (wireframes) that I used to put together the wireframes.
You can also find them on my Sketch cloud: <a href="https://www.sketch.com/s/c16a4788-9f6d-4825-bc30-e6dfe46c02d9" target="_blank">here.</a>

I was a bit indecisive on the colors to use for the app - so I asked my friends. (see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14R1SeQ06FlQoPNclrxN_aKawqDvkkncr/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">screencaps</a>)
Finally, I decided to use the first one because it gave a "video game" feeling (according to my friend) and that was exactly what I wanted. Even though the gradation looked good, I didn't keep it for the other screens because I knew that it would be a problem for the contrast. (see next section)
I also showed the prototype to some of my friends and I got a few remarks that were very useful and that I already changed in the first version that I posted in the section before. For example, I had some problems in establishing all the hotspots to comeback to the different screens - which could make the user stuck at some point.
Thank to the cognitive walktrough that I did in class, I got to also add a darker background for the bottom of the screen and put emphasis on the "return buttons" a little bit more.

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check.
I used the accessiblity plug-in Cluse to do the color-contrast check. It was definitely useful - at first, I wanted to use the exact same colors as the ones in the logo but I couldn't because they wouldn't pass the color-contrast check. I changed them a little bit and I don't think this is a big deal visually.
Proof of color-contrast check: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tXzjuQVIuz3GORlBX5VhD4LhfForhUuK/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">1</a> / <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWtFKeuwr-EnSseffIHII3Zp8oPcu490/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">2</a> 

## Interactive Prototype

## Cognitive Walktrough
In addition to the cognitive walkthrough made in class (see answer to the google form), I also completed a cognitive walktrough with a friend who sat next to me and went through the different scenario. It felt that for the moment, there was not any specific problem when it comes to dead-end. However, when it comes to the first scenario and the vowel exercise, at firstthere was no sign of progress, nor message telling the user if they were doing great or not. 
For that reason, I added a bubble on the picture of the BTS member that would help as a way to guide the user into the exercise. 
It was especially helpful because I was so immersed in the project and the fact that I needed to make screens for every single possibility that I forgot to add "in-between" stages. Now that I am writing this, I realize that there is no "error message" that would indicate sometime if the user was to press on a 한글 letter that was not a vowel. This is something to take into consideration for further versions.

## Reflection
The whole process of making the high-fidelity prototype was really fun! I like how something that was very vague in my head now seems way more concret now that it is prototyped. What I realized through this process, and especially when I designed the practice question to find vowels in the name of the BTS member, is that you have to imagine every single step and every single possibilities that could arise. It needs a lot of guess-work.
As I mentioned in my congitive walktrough findings, I need to meliorate a little bit the "feedback" given to the user to make sure they know how well they are doing, but also so that they keep engaged with the content. When it comes to design, I was very thankful to the test we had to do in class because I got a lot of nice feedback - I changed some little details (see the different versions of the prototype on the Sketch cloud).
