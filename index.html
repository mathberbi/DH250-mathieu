  Deok_UP (덕업) | Web Documentation</h1>

  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Deok_UP is an app to teach Korean through Korean Popular Culture Content. Deok_UP (덕업) is from the word 덕후 in Korean that means "fan" and 업 is a play on the word "UP" pronounced as 업 in Korean, but also a way to allude at the expression "덕업일치" that means "when something you enjoy becomes your work." - This saying kind of reflects well my wish to make people able to reach their personal/professional goal of learning Korean in a enjoyable way, and that's why I decided this name.</br>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>My research revolves around Korean popular culture (especially K-pop), its international reception and the consequences of it. In Korean studies, the relevance of K-pop and other Korean pop culture elements is always undermined - and yet, one of the biggest reason why students get into studying Korean is K-pop or K-dramas! Because of this, students take language classes and only few of them get into more content-oriented classes - and do not get further. I'd like to shape a project that take into consideration my teaching philosophy that is: content and language should equally be incorporated in the curriculum, and to do so, we should incorporate more Korean pop culture into Korean learning tools. The UX design that I am aiming for needs to be intuitive, and make the user should only focus on learning Korean without bothering of figuring out how the app works for a while before getting started.</p>

<h6><i>Usability Evaluation</i></h6>
<div class="card-body">
  <p>After the heuristic evaluation, my main concerns regarding the user design of TalktomeinKorean were as follow:
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item">The long-scrolling layout that could hide a lot of what the website has to offer.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">The navigation between the different lessons. (connection between system/real world)</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">The navigation inside of a lesson, too linear. (user control and freedom)</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">The difficulty of access for the help section. (help and documentation)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
Based on those four different heuristic points, I designed three different tasks that would make the user go over the table of contents of the lesson, but also go over the different parts of one lesson, and finally, access the help platform. After putting all together the material, I asked my participant to log in on zoom - set up their screen so it has both the website and the survey on the same window, and we then proceed to a screen recording in which I guided the participant through the different parts.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>Nowadays, there is a big gap in the field of Korean Studies between language classes who only focus on language and when learning about the culture, historical, and society context is in the background / and the content classes that are only focusing on the culture/historical/society aspects without going further in the language part. That leads to a problem in which students are either very knowledgeable about Korea but not proeficient in Korean, or the reverse situation. Using Korean pop culture as a gateway to learn Korean would help making more developed classes. Even if this problem is mainly related to the major of Korean Studies in University, of course using an online platform (digital technology aspect) would make the teaching material broadly available, and reach a wider target of people. Also, Korean pop culture relies heavily on social media platforms so it seems like it would be easy to integrate those elements all-together.</p>

          <p>Here are the main takes that I took from the contextual inquiry:
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Using YouTube as an external ressource</strong></li></br>
              <p>I found out that my participant was using YouTube and Tiktok as a ressource for their self-learning experience. The good aspect with YouTube is that it provides a lot of content from Korean media companies, and if embedded in a website/application it doesn't bring any problem of copyright - it even makes their views grow. The participant emphasized that YouTube had a lot of content for beginners, but not a lot for higher levels, starting intermediate.</p>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Importance of what happens "outside the classroom."</strong></li></br>
              <p>In their interview, the participant said that they feel accomplished when they could retrive something they learned in the classroom in another context. During the first task that had also as a goal to familiarize the learner with the different level of speechs in Korean, the participant stressed that in the classroom, because it was too formal of a setting, they never heard about 반말 or 존댓말. This cultural aspect is inherently related to language and helps fulfilling my intention of teaching both at the same time.</p>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The relevance of K-pop songs in Korean Learning</strong></li></br>
              <p>The participant enjoyed the first task way more than the second, and was way more responsive to the first one. Their idea that K-pop songs could be quite difficult to use for teaching was especially refreshing when they mentioned the different of pitch that made the prononciation different, and thus the exercise of "Fill in the blank" more difficult. However, they emphasized that with more context and a little bit more of indications, it could be helpful to figure out the grammar by themselves rather than being taught the grammar like a textbook.</p>
              <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Using Korean pop culture as a gateway to Korean learning... but what about the reverse effect?</strong></li></br>
            <p>My participant has an interesting relationship with pop culture because they qualify their interest for popular culture as "artificial" but still find it interesting/useful to use it as a way to learn more Korean. I think this show that using Korean pop culture for Korean language education could not only be seen as an effective tool, but in the reverse aspect, raise the popularity of some Korean pop culture aspects that do not get as many exposure as K-pop or K-dramas for example.</p>

                      <p>Tamera texts her friend to confess that she is into BTS now and that she wants to pick Korean again. Her friend - who is now taking Advanced Korean - tells her about Deok_UP, an app that uses Korean pop culture-related content as a pedagogical tool. She uses it to get grammar explanations and foster her vocabulary, but there is a section that teaches you how to read in only a week and even less! Tamera downloads Deok_UP, open the application. On the “introductions” screen, she clicks on “I can read Korean a bit.” She now has the choice to go through different programs that are adapted to how fast she wants to learn. 70 minutes / 7 hours / 7 days. Since she is so impatient, she chooses 1 hour. Using the name of BTS members, she gets to associate every letter with their reading. After an hour, she takes a test - she is already remembering some vowels!</p>

      <li>Do the first exercise (spot the vowels in BTS' Jin real name)</li>

<li><strong>Second scenario</strong></li>
<p>Shawn downloads the app and opens it. On the introduction page, he says that he can read. Who cannot read the Korean alphabet these days? He can read, knows basic grammars, but doesn’t really know how to use it. He goes through the different menu and finds the “Business Korean” section. That would be perfect for him! He taps it, and get access to a step-by-step college-like syllabus that go over the different aspects of Korean company culture, through a Korean drama called Misaeng. He starts the first lesson - that has listening, speaking, writing, and grammar/vocab section. He watches the first clip and can already catch some words that he knows! The whole lesson is about the culture of “company diners,” but also about levels of politeness and what to avoid using with co-workers.</p>

        <p>The whole process of making the high-fidelity prototype was really fun! I like how something that was very vague in my head now seems way more concret now that it is prototyped. What I realized through this process, and especially when I designed the practice question to find vowels in the name of the BTS member, is that you have to imagine every single step and every single possibilities that could arise. It needs a lot of guess-work. As I mentioned in my congitive walktrough findings, I need to meliorate a little bit the "feedback" given to the user to make sure they know how well they are doing, but also so that they keep engaged with the content. When it comes to design, I was very thankful to the test we had to do in class because I got a lot of nice feedback - I changed some little details (see the different versions of the prototype on the <a href="https://www.sketch.com/s/c16a4788-9f6d-4825-bc30-e6dfe46c02d9" target="_blank">Sketch cloud</a>).</p>
