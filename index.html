  Deok_UP (덕업) | Web Documentation</h1>
  <h2>By Mathieu Berbiguier, Ph. D. Student in Asian Languages and Cultures, UCLA.</h2>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Deok_UP is an app to teach Korean through Korean Popular Culture Content. Deok_UP (덕업) is from the word 덕후 in Korean that means "fan" and 업 is a play on the word "UP" pronounced as 업 in Korean, but also a way to allude at the expression "덕업일치" that means "when something you enjoy becomes your work." - This saying kind of reflects well my wish to make people able to reach their personal/professional goal of learning Korean in a enjoyable way, and that's why I decided this name.</p>

    <p class="card-text">My research revolves around Korean popular culture (especially K-pop), its international reception and the consequences of it. In Korean studies, the relevance of K-pop and other Korean pop culture elements is always undermined - and yet, one of the biggest reason why students get into studying Korean is K-pop or K-dramas! Because of this, students take language classes and only few of them get into more content-oriented classes - and do not get further. I'd like to shape a project that take into consideration my teaching philosophy that is: content and language should equally be incorporated in the curriculum, and to do so, we should incorporate more Korean pop culture into Korean learning tools. The UX design that I am aiming for needs to be intuitive, and make the user should only focus on learning Korean without bothering of figuring out how the app works for a while before getting started.</p>

**Type of Info** | **Application 1** | **Application 2**
------------ | ------------- | -------------
**Name** | Talk to me in Korean (TTMIK) | Koreanclass101
**URL** | https://talktomeinkorean.com/ | https://www.koreanclass101.com/
**Screenshot** | ![screenshot_intro1](./app1_0.png) | ![screenshot_intro2](./app2_0.png)
**Presentation** | One of the most famous website to learn Korean. They started as podcasts and developped into an interactive textbook that is subscription based. There is also a free version, which is the one I will test in this assignment. | Similarly with Talk to me in Korean, KoreanClass101 also offers Korean classes - they are also subscription based but seem to offer more features in their free trial than TTMIK.
**Overall evaluation** | Overall, TTMIK adopts a very minimalist aesthetic, with pastel colors and not a lot of informations shown on the screen. The choice of having a long-scrolling website, is, in my opinion, the main reason makes some of the heuristic principles hardly applicable on it. | On the other hand, KoreanClass101 adopts a less pleasing aesthetic, yet more functional design - but maybe a little bit too much. There is too many informations on the screen and the user can easily feel lost, and does not really not what to do.
> In conclusion, the analysis of both websites helped me to understand that I would like something in the middle: as functional as KoreanClass101, but as esthetically pleasing as TTMIK.
