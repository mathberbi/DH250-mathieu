# DH250: User Experience and Design - Assignment 01
## Tentative Project Name: Deok_UP - Learn Korean through Korean Pop Culture! 
*Mathieu Berbiguier, Ph. D. Student (ALC)*

> My research revolves around Korean popular culture (especially K-pop), its international reception and the consequences of it. In Korean studies, the relevance of K-pop and other Korean pop culture elements are always undermined - and yet, one of the biggest reason why students get into studying Korean is K-pop or K-dramas! Because of this, students only take language classes and few of them get into more content-oriented classes - and do not get further. I'd like to shape a project that take into consideration my teaching philosophy that is: content and language should equally be incorporated in the curriculum, and to do so, we should incorporate more Korean pop culture into Korean learning tools. The UX design that I am aiming for needs to be intuitive, and the user should only focus on learning Korean and not bother of learning how the app works for a while before getting started.

Information | One of the most famous website to learn Korean. They started as podcasts and developped into an interactive textbook that is subscription based. There is also a free version, which is the one I will test in this assignment. | Similarly with Talk to me in Korean, KoreanClass101 also offers Korean classes - they are also subscription based but seem to offer more features in their free trial than TTMIK.
Overall evaluation | Overall, TTMIK adopts a very minimalist aesthetic, with pastel colors and not a lot of informations shown on the screen. The choice of having a long-scrolling website, is, in my opinion, what makes some of the heuristic principles hardly applicable on it. | On the other hand, KoreanClass101 adopts a less pleasing aesthetic, yet more functional - but maybe a little bit too much. There is too many informations on the screen and the user can easily feel lost, and does not really not what to do.
> In conclusion, the analysis of both websites helped me to understand that I would like something as functional as KoreanClass101, but as esthetically pleasing as TTMIL.

### Heuristics Evaluation of TTMIK
#### (1) Visibility of System Status 
> **RESPECTED** - 1) There is a progression bar that appears often, during the level test (made to guide you through the different levels/lessons), but also while going over the content of the lesson themselves.

> 2) The menu reminds you in which page you are located by underlining the position of the user in the website map.

**Severity Rating:** 1 

#### (2) Connection between System/Real World
> **INCOMPLETE** - Not really ways to navigate in the "textbook" - wish it would work like a book, with arrows, pages, some animations — the only arrow is at the end of the scrolling page.
