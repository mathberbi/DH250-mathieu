# DH250: User Experience and Design - Assignment 01
## Tentative Project Name: Deok_UP // Learn Korean through Korean Pop Culture! 
*Mathieu Berbiguier, Ph. D. Student (ALC)*

> My research revolves around Korean popular culture (especially K-pop), its international reception and the consequences of it. In Korean studies, the relevance of K-pop and other Korean pop culture elements is always undermined - and yet, one of the biggest reason why students get into studying Korean is K-pop or K-dramas! Because of this, students take language classes and only few of them get into more content-oriented classes - and do not get further. I'd like to shape a project that take into consideration my teaching philosophy that is: content and language should equally be incorporated in the curriculum, and to do so, we should incorporate more Korean pop culture into Korean learning tools. The UX design that I am aiming for needs to be intuitive, and make the user should only focus on learning Korean without bothering of figuring out how the app works for a while before getting started. Also, I feel like the interface of both apps is quite stiff - so adding elements that alludes with Korean pop culture in my app could be a way to make it a little bit more attractive.

**Type of Info** | **Application 1** | **Application 2** 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
**Name** | Talk to me in Korean (TTMIK) | Koreanclass101
**URL** | https://talktomeinkorean.com/ | https://www.koreanclass101.com/
**Screenshot** | ![screenshot_intro1](./app1_0.png) | ![screenshot_intro2](./app2_0.png)
**Presentation** | One of the most famous website to learn Korean. They started as podcasts and developped into an interactive textbook that is subscription based. There is also a free version, which is the one I will test in this assignment. | Similarly with Talk to me in Korean, KoreanClass101 also offers Korean classes - they are also subscription based but seem to offer more features in their free trial than TTMIK.
**Overall evaluation** | Overall, TTMIK adopts a very minimalist aesthetic, with pastel colors and not a lot of informations shown on the screen. The choice of having a long-scrolling website, is, in my opinion, the main reason makes some of the heuristic principles hardly applicable on it. | On the other hand, KoreanClass101 adopts a less pleasing aesthetic, yet more functional design - but maybe a little bit too much. There is too many informations on the screen and the user can easily feel lost, and does not really not what to do.
> In conclusion, the analysis of both websites helped me to understand that I would like something in the middle: as functional as KoreanClass101, but as esthetically pleasing as TTMIK.

### Heuristics Evaluation of TTMIK
#### (1) Visibility of System Status 
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **RESPECTED** 
**Example 1** | There is a progression bar that appears often, during the level test (made to guide you through the different levels/lessons), but also while going over the content of the lesson themselves. 
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-1](./app1_1.1.png) ![screenshot_app1-2](./app1_1.2.png) ![screenshot_app1-3](./app1_1.3.png)
**Example 2** | The menu reminds you in which page you are located by underlining the position of the user in the website map.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-4](./app1_1_5.png)
**Severity Rating** | **1**

#### (2) Connection between System/Real World
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **INCOMPLETE** 
**Example 1** | Since the website appears to be an online textbook, it would have been good to recreate the experience of "reading" or "going over" the textbook: with arrows, pages, some animations. Here the only arrow is at the bottom of the scrolling page, and just makes you go to the next lesson.

**Severity Rating** | **2**

#### (3) User Control and Freedom
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **NOT RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | The layout of the page when it comes to lessons is too linear, and we can't navigate between the tabs once we are scrolling further down. The tabs that were showing the script of the lesson, but also the quiz, disapear.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-6](./app1_7.png)(Example of the layout of a lesson)
**Example 2** | Every lesson starts with an embedded file from soundcloud that the learner is supposed to listen while following along to the text of the lesson. It would have been great to incorporate a audio player that makes it possible to pause while reading.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-7](./app1_3.png)
**Severity Rating** | **3**

#### (4) Consistency and Standards
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **INCOMPLETE**
**Example 1** | There is a lack of consistency when it comes to the availability of the "help" page. It appears on the main menu, the dashboard that shows the progress in the learning.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-8](./app1_1_5.png) but it doesn't appear inside a lesson. ![screenshot_app1-9](./app1_4_10.png)
**Severity Rating** | **2**

#### (5) Error Prevention
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **NOT RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | When you leave the level test by mistake, it just gives you the result considering how far in the questions you went - it does not ask you a question like "Do you really want to end the level test?" which could be very frustrating. Same when taking a quiz. This is a screenshot that shows that they told me to go to level 1 because I clicked on another link by mistake while taking the test.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-10](./app1_5.png)
**Severity Rating** | **3**

#### (6) Recognition rather than Recall
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **RESPECTED** 
**Example 1** | Recalls what was the last lesson you worked on so you can start again where you left it.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-11](./app1_6.png)
**Severity Rating** | **1**

#### (7) Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **NOT RESPECTED** 
**Example 1** | No shortcuts of any sort, even to use during the quizzes.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-12](./app1_7.png)
**Severity Rating** | **2**

#### (8) Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **INCOMPLETE**
**Example 1** | The layout of the website makes that it focuses always on the essential information but because of the constant use of scrolling design for every part, it makes the user sometimes miss important indications. For example, after the level test, the website suggests you lessons and books to purchase, but we can't see them unless we scroll.

**Severity Rating** | **2**

#### (9) Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **INCOMPLETE**
**Example 1** | Explains clearly and highlights where the problem is (log in screen).
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-14](./app1_9.png)
**Example 2** | After a quiz, the only way to re-take it is to "undo" the lesson, but the button is not easy to find.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-15](./app1_9.2.png) (screen after taking a quiz) ![screenshot_app1-16](./app1_9.3.png)(screen that shows where to "undo" the lesson - on a different page than where the quiz was taken.)
**Example 3** | When an error occurs during a search, there is no suggestion to recover.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-17](./app1_10.png)
**Severity Rating** | **3**

#### (10) Help and Documentation
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **INCOMPLETE**
**Example 1** | Help page is very well designed but hosted on a different platform and doesn't appear on the screen of the lessons. 
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app1-18](./app1_10.3.png)

### Heuristics Evaluation of KoreanClass101
#### (1) Visibility of System Status 
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **(ALMOST) RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | Menu is not very contextual and doesn't show where you are. 
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-1](./app2_1.png)
**Example 2** | The dashboard gives you an overview of your progress in the pathway that you chose to follow. It also gives you statistics on how much you have learned for motivation.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-2](./app2_1.2.png)
**Severity Rating** | **1**

#### (2) Connection between System/Real World
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | The pesentation of the levels is more appealing than TTMIK with a "task list" that seems more easy to understand. 
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-3](./app2_2.png)
**Severity Rating** | **1**

#### (3) User Control and Freedom
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | Way more control than in TTMIK because it doesn't use the integration of soundcloud - possibility to control the audio while looking at the rest of the lesson + read the dialogue sentence by sentence. 
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-4](./app2_3.png)(Example of the layout of a lesson)
**Example 2** | You can hide parts of the lesson, and elements that you do not want to see.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-5](./app2_3.2.png)
**Example 3** | There are ways to go to a specific part but no ways to come back to the top of the page, which could be frustrating.
**Severity Rating** | **3**

#### (4) Consistency and Standards
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **(ALMOST) RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | Uses conventionl icons (external consistency).
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-6](./app2_4.2.png)
**Example 2** | However, there is a lack of consistency regarding the availability of the "contact" button that appears on the dashboard; in the bottom-right side. Once in the lesson, we can't access it.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-7](./app2_4.1.png)
**Severity Rating** | **1**

#### (5) Error Prevention
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | Ask questions before deleting/resetting the desk cards.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-8](./app2_5.png)
![screenshot_app2-9](./app2_5.2.png)
**Severity Rating** | **1**

#### (6) Recognition rather than Recall
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **NOT RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | Even though you can choose a pathway and stick to it, if you do not do the lessons in the order they tell you, there is no way to know where you left it when you come back.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-10](./app2_6.png)The only solution is to go in "My report" which is a page that is hidden in a contextual menu. ![screenshot_app2-11](./app2_6.2.png)
**Severity Rating** | **2**

#### (7) Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **(ALMOST) RESPECTED**
**Example 1** | Possibility to directly go to email account to activate account.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-12](./app2_7_10.png)
**Example 2** | Shortcuts available to use when reviewing desks - but there is no way to know what they are unless we read the Q&A page.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-13](./app2_7.png)![screenshot_app2-14](./app2_7.2.png)
**Severity Rating** | **2**

#### (8) Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
**Category** | **Element**
------------ | ------------- 
**Status of Criteria** | **INCOMPLETE**
**Example 1** | Even though there is, like TTMIK, a scrolling design - it is easier to navigate, thanks to the bar that is embedded at the top of the screen. Sometimes, the abundance of information might be a little confusing.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-15](./app2_8.png)
**Severity Rating** | **1**

#### (9) Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
**Category** | **Element**

**Example 1** | Contextual help is provided for example for activation of the account.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-20](./app1_4_10.png)
**Example 2** | However, the search feature is not very intuitive.
**Screencaps** | ![screenshot_app2-21](./app2_10.png)
**Example 3** | The feature of the "chat" with a teacher could have been more exploited.
