# DH250: User Experience and Design - Assignment 01
## Tentative Project Name: Deok_UP - Learn Korean through Korean Pop Culture! 
*Mathieu Berbiguier, Ph. D. Student (ALC)*

> My research revolves around Korean popular culture (especially K-pop), its international reception and the consequences of it. In Korean studies, the relevance of K-pop and other Korean pop culture elements are always undermined - and yet, one of the biggest reason why students get into studying Korean is K-pop or K-dramas! Because of this, students only take language classes and few of them get into more content-oriented classes - and do not get further. I'd like to shape a project that take into consideration my teaching philosophy that is: content and language should equally be incorporated in the curriculum, and to do so, we should incorporate more Korean pop culture into Korean learning tools. The UX design that I am aiming for needs to be intuitive, and the user should only focus on learning Korean and not bother of learning how the app works for a while before getting started.
