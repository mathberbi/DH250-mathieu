# DH250_Assignment 06_Low Fidelity Prototype
## Description of Project, Features and Relevance with Scenario
Deok_UP is an app to teach Korean through Korean Popular Culture Content. Deok_UP (덕업) is from the word 덕후 in Korean that means "fan" and 업 is a play on the word "UP" pronounced as 업 in Korean, but also a way to allude at the expression "덕업일치" that means "when something you enjoy becomes your work." - This saying kind of reflects well my wish to make people able to reach their personal/professional goal of learning Korean in a enjoyable way, and that's why I decided this name. In this assignment, I will focus on the two scenarios who starred the two persona that I introduced in the last assignment, and extract specific tasks from them. The purpose of this low-fidelity proptotype is to evaluate way to integrate content that is already online.

**First Scenario/Persona**
> Tamera texts her friend to confess that she is into BTS now and that she wants to pick Korean again. Her friend - who is now taking Advanced Korean - tells her about Deok_UP, an app that uses Korean pop culture-related content as a pedagogical tool. She uses it to get grammar explanations and foster her vocabulary, but there is a section that teaches you how to read in only a week and even less! Tamera downloads Deok_UP, open the application. On the “introductions” screen, she clicks on “I am starting from scratch.” She now has the choice to go through different programs that are adapted to how fast she wants to learn. 1 week / 3 days / 1 hour. Since she is so impatient, she chooses 1 hour. Using the name of BTS members, she gets to associate every letter with their reading. After an hour, she takes a test - she is already doing better!
* Tasks/Features from the first scenario
  - Set a new account on Deok_UP
  - Access the "express" review mode of 한글
  - Review the Vowels and start the first exercise
  

**Second Scenario/Persona**
> Shawn downloads the app and opens it. On the introduction page, he takes a quick level test and gets diagnosed as an “advanced beginner.” Fair enough! He can read, knows basic grammars, but doesn’t really know how to use it. He goes through the different menu and finds the “Business Korean” section. That would be perfect for him! He taps it, and get access to a step-by-step college-like syllabus that go over the different aspects of Korean company culture, through a Korean drama called Misaeng. He starts the first lesson - that has listening, speaking, writing, and grammar/vocab section. He watches the first clip and can already catch some words that he knows! The whole lesson is about the culture of “company diners,” but also about levels of politeness and what to avoid using with co-workers. 
* Tasks/Features from the second scenario
  - Set a new account on Deok_UP
  - Access to "Survival Korean" and "Business Korean - Level 1"
  - Watch the first clip to practice listening

## Wireframes, Wireflow
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sov0bH33vreH7Ux48aU1gqcvQjcgP7w0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> is a PDF of all the different screens (wireframes) that I used to put together the wireframes
You can find the first version of the wireflow of the different screens, with a legend that corresponds to the different scenarios: <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/tff7RL3tw" target="_blank">here.</a>

## Tests
I conducted two different tests of the wireflow - one for the first scenario, and one for the second.
For each tasks listed in the different tasts, I asked my tester to use a different color - and asked them to write down their comments as they were working on it.

## Reflection and Changes
Thanks to my tester, I figured out a lot of details that I forgot when I made the wireframes and linked them all-together. Here is a list of details that the tester pointed, and how I changed them (cf. to the second and updated version of the wireflow below).
* For test 1
  - The tester thought that by clicking "yes" on "Do you know Hangul?" they could access the program of learning the Korean Alphabet, but in my initial wireflow, that was not the case. I added a case "Yes, a little bit" to avoid confusion.
  - The tester didn't know where to press to access the lesson on "vowels," so I made the shape of the button clearer.
  - Test 1, the tester didn't know what to do on the exercise that asked to spot the vowels in the name of the member of BTS. I haven't found a solution yet, but I'm working on it.
* For test 2
  - The "new account" and "log-in" screen succession wasn't very clear, so I changed it.
  - The tester suggested that there was a warning message before the clip plays to tell the user to put their screen on the side, so I added it.
